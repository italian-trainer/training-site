        <h1>Alcohol Awareness</h1>
        <p>
            As a server for Maria’s Italian Kitchen, alcohol service will be a big part of
            your job. It’s a part of your job that comes with a lot of accountability.
        </p>
        
        <p> <strong>
            As a server for Maria’s Italian Kitchen, YOU are responsible for the safe and appropriate
            service of alcoholic beverages within the law. </strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Responsible alcohol service impacts the safety of our guests and neighbors, and the liability of
            our restaurants and team members. When a drunk driver is involved in an driver was
            served liable for the damage caused, and that liability extends to the server or bartender
            who brought them the drinks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As a step toward protecting against the likelihood of “over service”, restaurants like Maria’s have
            developed policies and practices for monitoring the service of alcohol. While management is there for
            100% support on this issue when you need them, as the server, you will be
            the person in the best position to make critical judgments about whether or not it
            is safe to continue serving a guest.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We also want you to have all the information you need to make responsible decisions.
            If you stay aware of what is happening at your tables, and keep the following
            Key Points in mind, you won’t have any issues.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Points of Responsible Alcohol Service</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When in doubt, ask a manager for input or assistance
            </li>
            
            <li>
                At the first point you think a guest may be too intoxicated, you need to
                alert a manager. They can help you keep an eye on the guest and help
                determine the next best course of action
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Signs of intoxication include: slurred speech, erratic behavior, loud or offensive conduct, slowed reactions and
                being argumentative
            </li>
            
            <li>
                The legal limit for driving is a Blood Alcohol Content of .08. For anyone less
                than 200 lbs. that only takes 3 drinks
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Do not serve any guest more than one alcoholic drink at a time
            </li>
            
            <li>
                You should check ID for anyone who looks younger than 35
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    No ID = NO ALCOHOLIC DRINK
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If an ID looks suspicious or fake, you do not have to serve them
                </li>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Always alert a manager if this happens
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                Minors are NOT allowed to drink for any reason, even if a parent says it
                is ok
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Maria’s company policy is: DO NOT serve non-alcoholic beer to minors
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Be aware that guests may have started drinking somewhere else and sometimes even arrive intoxicated
            </li>
            
            <li>
                A guest who has become visibly intoxicated will always be offered alternative transportation if they
                need it
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Do not attempt to “cut off” a guest on your own. Always alert your manager
                and allow them to have this discussion with the guest
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Maria’s Italian Kitchen is committed to the responsible service of alcoholic beverages 
            to our guests. We are also committed to actions that will help reduce drunk driving. Accordingly, 
            all team members are required to follow the procedures listed below:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                No team members will serve an alcoholic beverage to any person less than 21 years
                of age or to any person who is visibly intoxicated.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                In order to be served an alcoholic beverage, any guest who is apparently under 35
                years of age is required to present documentation that shows him or her to be
                21 years or older. Acceptable documentation is a driver’s license with photo or photo identification
                issued by a governmental agency.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The team member will check the identification to ascertain that it is authentic. The manager
                    should be informed if there is any appearance of forgery or tampering.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    In the absence of authentic identification, or in case of doubt, the team member will
                    refuse service of alcoholic beverages to the guest.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                It is the team member’s responsibility to notify a manager immediately when a guest shows
                visible signs of intoxication. The manager will then inform the guest that further service of
                alcoholic beverages is no longer legal and suggest alternative refreshment.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Any guest showing visible signs of intoxication will be urged to use the alternative transportation
                provided by the establishment. If, after strong urging, he or she refuses, a reasonable attempt
                should be made to obtain the keys to his or her car.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                If, despite these efforts, the intoxicated guest leaves in his or her car, the license
                plate number should be noted and the appropriate law enforcement officials should be notified.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                After refusing service to any patron, team members will note the appearance and clothing of
                the individual involved. A form will then be obtained from the manager, filled out and
                filed in the logbook.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                All drinks will be measured according to restaurant policy.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                No team member will serve more than one drink to a guest at one time.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                No team member will serve several drinks to a guest during a short interval.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                All team members who serve alcoholic beverages will participate in a designated alcohol awareness training
                program when beginning employment at Maria’s Italian Kitchen.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                I have completed the Alcohol Awareness section of my training manual and read this policy
                statement. I understand what is required in regard to responsible alcoholic beverages service and promise
                to follow these rules
            </li>
