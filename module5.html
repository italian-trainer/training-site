                <li>Greeting the Guests</li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                You get the first opportunity to make our guests feel welcome as they come through
                the door. You’re their first impression so it needs to be a good one!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every guest should get a warm, smiling welcome. 
                    <br/><em>“Hi, welcome to Maria’s! How are you doing this evening?”</em>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    You also need to identify how many guests are in the group. Sometimes it seems
                    obvious but you never want to assume, so it’s always good to ask. 
                    <br/><em>“Two for dinner this evening?”</em>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Once you know how many guests, you can select a table where you would like
                    to seat them. 
                    <br/>You should already have a table in mind that fits with your
                    rotation. Always be thinking ahead, so that when the guest arrives you can get them
                    to a table quickly. 
                    <br/>Make sure that the table is completely prepared and ready for
                    guest seating before you start toward it with guests. Is it fully set for the
                    right number? Is it ready with any needed high chairs or booster seats?
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Now you just need to grab the appropriate number of menus and lead the guests
                    through the dining room to the table. 
                    <br/><em>“Right this way.”</em>
                    <br/><strong>OR</strong> 
                    <br/><em>“Just follow me and we’ll get you to a table.”</em>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Occasionally, guests may seat themselves, bypassing the host stand and heading straight for the table
                they want. If you’re in a restaurant with multiple entrances, this might be more common,
                so it’s important for you to be aware of guests entering through both doors.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s ok, when that happens. You just need to follow them to the table with
                the menus they’ll need and welcome them to Maria’s just like you would any other
                guest. It’s also more likely in these instances that there might be a break in
                your planned seating rotation or that they’ve selected a table that isn’t currently assigned to
                a server. If that’s the case, make sure you adjust your rotation accordingly, and make
                sure the table gets picked-up by a server.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>Walking to the Table</li>
            </h3>

            <p>
                As you guide your guests to their table, you don’t want to dash ahead of
                them and hope they keep up. You may be busy, but our guests are joining
                us for a relaxing meal and we want them to feel comfortable and welcomed, not
                hurried.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Here are some key things to remember on the way to the table:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don’t walk too fast. Guests may not be in as big a hurry as you
                    are.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Be certain of which table you’re headed to before you leave the host stand and
                    take the shortest route through the dining room.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Make small talk with the guest and use their name if you know it. Ask
                    about their day or the weather.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    When you arrive at the table, pull out a chair for someone if you can
                    and step to one side as everyone takes a seat.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <li>Delivering the Menus</li>
            </h3>

            <p>
                You never want to arrive at the table and just set the menus down, then walk away.
                Allow guests to be seated, then hand each one their menu(s).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each guest should get our regular menu and a wine list should be placed on
                    the table. 
                    <br/><em>
                        “I’ve got some menus for you, here, and I’m just going to place
                        this wine list here on the table.”
                    </em> 
                    <br/>At times, there may also be a specials
                    menu that needs to go to each table, as well, and there may be special
                    instructions on how you should deal with those menus. Your trainer will let you know
                    what menus are currently being offered. 
                    <br/>Some guests might not reach out to take the
                    menu from you, so you’ll just politely lay it on the table in front of
                    them.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Once guests have menus, you simply need to wish them a nice meal, and make
                    sure the server knows about the new table. <br/> <em>“Enjoy your dinner!”</em>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>
                <li>Alerting the Server</li>
            </h3>

            <p>
                Before you head back to the host stand, it’s good to let the server you
                just seated know that they have a new table. Usually they’re around their section anyway,
                and simple eye contact or making sure they see you as you’re seating the guests
                is enough. Other times you may need to make a pass by the POS or
                through the expo line to let them know.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This helps the servers make a plan for getting around to their new tables, as
                soon as possible, and in really busy circumstances may be an opportunity for them to
                let you know there a little behind, so it might be best to wait a
                bit before seating them again.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On some shifts there may be tables that aren’t pre-assigned to servers. Those are called
                “pick-up” tables, and they need to be assigned as they’re seated. You’ll work with the
                manager throughout the shift to determine which server should pick up the tables that are
                seated in the pick-up section. Your manager might give you some direction at the start
                of the shift, or they may give you direction as you go. If you have
                to seat a pick- up table that you haven’t already been given some direction for,
                your next stop should be the manager.
            </p>


            <h3>
                <li>Thank the Guest</li>
            </h3>

            <p>
                The most important words our guests can hear from you are “Thank you.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Just like you are most often the first person our guests see when they come
                through the door, you will very often also be the last Maria’s team member they
                pass on the way out the door.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Letting each guest know they were appreciated puts the finishing touch on the quality of
                their experience, and it’s just one more thing you can do to be of service
                and help make Maria’s the friendliest family restaurant in the neighborhood.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you can, open the door for them, ask how everything was and invite them
                to come back, soon. The warm and accommodating service people have come to expect from
                Maria’s Italian Kitchen means going out of our way for every guest from the time
                they arrive to the time they leave. Saying “thank you” goes a long way, and
                paired with a genuine smile, it can leave our guests with a positive final impression
                of us on their way home.
