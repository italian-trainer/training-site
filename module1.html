        <h2>Maria’s History</h2>
        <p> Yes, there really is a Maria! </p>
        <p> Maria Alfano moved to California from Hoboken, New Jersey, a place then sometimes
            called “Little Italy”, with her husband in the 1960’s. After arriving on the West Coast,
            they opened a small neighborhood market in Brentwood Village. It was in the small
            garage space next door, in 1975, that Maria opened her first kitchen and began offering
            classic Italian dishes made with the recipes her own mother Luisa had brought with her
            from Naples. Soon, the delicious food and friendly service had neighborhood families
            flocking in, and the first Maria’s was a huge success. </p>
        <p> In 1985, Maria’s daughter, Madelyn, realized her vision of opening a real sit-down
            trattoria, just like the ones in Italy, when she opened the first Maria’s Italian Kitchen, in
            Sherman Oaks. That was just the beginning.
        </p>
        <p> Today, Maria’s Italian Kitchen, still run by Madelyn, is an established and well-
            recognized L.A. staple with more than ten locations and growing! The recipes still call
            for only the finest ingredients, a passion for cooking and a love for the classic flavor of
            real homemade Italian food. </p>
        <p>Maria’s has grown from its humble beginnings to the success it is today in no small part
            due to the quality of people that make up our team and the culture of a real “family” that
            we all share. That ongoing growth means opportunity for every member of the team,
            and that now includes you. We are glad to have you as part of the family and hope you’ll
            be proud to be a part of Maria’s rich and continuing history.</p>

        <h2>Maria’s Culture</h2>
        <p>Maria’s Italian Kitchen is about family, and we consider every member of this small
            company to be a part of that family. We work together every day with pride and respect;
            pride and respect for the jobs we do and for the people we work with.
            We make it a point to treat each and every member of our family with dignity and
            consideration as an individual. That attitude and commitment to people is a big part of
            creating the positive and welcoming atmosphere that makes Maria’s such a great place
            to come out and eat AND a great place to work.</p>
        <p>We are dedicated to these principles of family, loyalty and respect not just because
            they’re part of what makes Maria’s successful as a business, but simply because that’s
            what our team members deserve as people.</p>
        <p>That dedication carries over to the way we treat and serve our guests. Maria’s takes
            pride in being a neighborhood restaurant with great service from a friendly,
            knowledgeable team. We value each and every guest that comes through our doors,
            and the quality of their experience is our number one concern. Every guest is YOUR
            guest and we know as a member of the Maria’s family you will be welcoming, friendly
            and of service.</p>
        <p>Come in with a positive attitude and a smile for your guests and fellow team members,
            and always show respect for everyone you see. That’s what it means to be a part of the
            Maria’s family.</p>
