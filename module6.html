        <h1>Server: Sequence of Service Part 2</h1>

        <h3>5. Take Entree Order</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you’ve delivered the drinks, and hopefully have an appetizer working, it’s time to
            get to the main course! Most of the time, guests will likely be ready to
            order when you return with their drinks but they may have questions and need a
            little guidance so you have to be ready for that. There is also more to
            taking an order than just writing down what the guest asks for. We want you
            to be a server, not just an order-taker.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There is a lot to consider, but after we go over a few of the
            details we’ll take a look at an example script of the whole process, and you’ll
            be doing plenty of role-play with your trainer to practice.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                It may take a minute or two to get the order at a table depending
                on the number of guests and how much help they need from you in making
                a decision, so you need to be ready to spend that time with them before
                you start.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Timing everything happening in your section so that all your guests are taken care of
                    will come with experience.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If you aren’t ready to take an order when you return with the drinks, simply
                    drop them off and politely say with a smile, “And I will be right back
                    to take your order.”
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Remember, you are in control of timing all your tables to ensure the quality of
                    the guest experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                When you approach a table to take an order, it’s always a good idea to
                start by finding out if they have any questions about the menu.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>
                        “Do we have any questions about the menu or have we already made some decisions
                        about dinner?”
                    </em>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If the table isn’t ready, simply let them know you’ll be back around in a
                    couple minutes.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <em>“Okay, take your time and I’ll come back around in couple minutes.”</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                When guests have questions, use your menu knowledge, experience and read of the table to
                help guide them in the best direction.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Guests frequently have questions about timing, ingredients, portion size, sides, preferences, allergies, substitutions, additions and
                    a lot of other things.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Answering everything correctly may take some experience so don’t be afraid to go looking for
                    an answer, but never tell a guest something you are unsure of. Always check when
                    you don’t know.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                Once everyone is ready, grab your pen and pad and get started.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                It’s common practice to always start with ladies first. Sometime they may pass, but you
                should always give them the first opportunity.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                As you write orders down you need to use a pivot system.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Seat numbers are a system of order taking where you write down guests’ orders according
                    to the positions where they are seated at the table. (See the Ringing Orders and
                    Timing Courses section in this workbook.)
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    This allows you to ring orders in a way that will help you, or anyone
                    else delivering the order, get the correct items to the correct guests without auctioning them
                    off.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                Echo orders back to the guest so that they know they have been heard and
                you can confirm that you have the correct order. (See example script below)
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Echoing back with each guest is better than waiting until everyone has ordered and reading
                    the entire order back to the whole party.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                After each guest orders, you should also offer them a salad to start with.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is best to do this with each guest as you go, rather than waiting
                    until the end and saying “And did anyone want a salad to start with?”
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Use your sales skills.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now, you need practice! That means lots of role-play with your trainer. Start easy at
            first with just the basics and then ask your trainer to start throwing in a
            few curve balls. Make sure you’re listening in as your trainers are taking orders, as
            well. By the end of your third shift, you’ll be doing it on your own.
        </p>


        <h3>6. Rosemary Bread Service</h3>
        <p>
            Our rosemary is delicious and we're very proud of it so we want to make
            sure it's offered to every guest. So once you've got the order, simply ask your
            guests if they'd like rosemary bread and, if the answer is yes, make sure it
            gets to the table. You can ask your busser to deliver it for you, but
            if you have time you should do it yourself. The more your guests see you
            the better.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We like for you to hold off on Bread Service until after the order is
            taken because that increases your chances of getting appetizers and salads on the table. Guests
            are less likely to order those kinds of “extras” if they already have bread in
            front of them, so it’s better for your check total to wait.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But we know guests LOVE our Rosemary Bread and, since we have a lot of
            regulars, you’ll find that some people start asking for it right away. So if a
            guest asks for bread, just bring it. Your first priority is to get the guest
            what they want, not force them into an ideal guest experience that we have in
            mind.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Our Rosemary bread service portion is “Plus One.” That means one more piece of bread
                than the number of guests: Two guests = Three pieces of bread, and so on.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If a guest asks for more, they can have it.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Rosemary Bread is not limited so a guest can have as many refills on their
                    basket as they ask for but there is no need to continue offering it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                Since we are so proud of our rosemary bread, we also want you to tell
                each table a little about it and the olive oil dip that comes with it.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>“Here we have our signature Rosemary Bread, enjoy.”</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>


        <h3>7. Prepare Table for First Course</h3>
        <p>
            Before the first course arrives you should do a little table maintenance and double- check
            the table to make sure they have everything they need. The goal is to ensure
            that the guest always has everything they need before they need it.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Missing silverware
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Napkins
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Drink refills
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Pizza Stands
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Etc.
            </li>
            
        </ul>

        <p>
            You also want to remove any items your guests don’t need.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Discarded straws
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Used napkins
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Empty Sugar packets
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Empty bread baskets
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Empty glasses
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Keep your guests comfortable and happy by keeping a clean, well-maintained table and anticipating their
            needs. This is something you should continue to do throughout service.
        </p>


        <h3>8. Serve First Course (4-9 minutes)</h3>
        <p>
            It's your responsibility to make sure that everything your guests order makes it to the
            table when it's supposed to, so if you've got a first course rung in, make
            sure you're on top of looking out for it to show up in the window.
            Sometimes you might get some help from others running hot items out to the table,
            but you shouldn't fall back on expecting that. Make it a goal to run everything
            yourself, as often as possible.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Items should be presented to guests without having to ask who gets what. We don’t
                want to “auction off” food.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Double check that the guest has everything they need like side plates or accompanying sauces.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Check back in at the table after a minute or two to ensure the guest
                is happy.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This may only require a look in, or making eye contact, to see that the
                    guest isn’t wanting for anything.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If you stop to inquire, be specific: <em>“How is that calamari?”</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                You will need to keep an eye on the table to see how quickly they
                are progressing so that you can make any appropriate decisions about timing the main course.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>9. Main Course Sent</h3>
        <p>
            If you’ve got a main course on hold it should most likely be sent to
            the kitchen by this point.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You won’t always have to hold your main courses, we’ll talk a little bit more
            about that in Ringing and Timing Orders, but anytime you have multiple courses you’ll need
            to figure out how to best time those courses so they arrive to the table
            at the appropriate time.
        </p>            

        <h3>10. Clear First Course</h3>
        <p>
            As soon as your guests are done with their first course it should be removed
            from the table.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Prepare Table for Main Course</h3>
        <p>
            Before your main courses arrive the table needs to be ready. This step is almost
            identical to Step 7: Prepare Table for First Course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is also an excellent time to double check beverages for refills or offer new
            cocktails and wine.
        </p>
    
        <h3>12. Serve Main Course</h3>
        <p>
            Now let’s get the main course on the table.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When delivering food to your guests, it’s important to remember that we don’t “auction off”
            the individual items, our ask guests “who gets what?” Thanks to ringing everything in according
            to seat numbers, we can let the ticket be our guide. This is especially important
            when someone else is running your food, which happens a lot at Maria’s so you
            want to always remember to ring your items under the correct positions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What you should do when delivering entrées, is announce each item as you place it
            in front of the guest
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>“The Spaghetti with Meat Sauce for the lady. And a Veggie Lasagna for you sir”</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            may be running food out to a table as a team. When that happens, each
            person needs to check the ticket before leaving the window so they know to which
            seat they’ll be serving the items they’re carrying. It’s also a good idea for someone
            to always bring the ticket with them to double-check that everyone at the table has
            everything they ordered.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Once all the entrées have been delivered, you’ll want to check if there is anything
            else your guests need and let them know you’ll be back around to check on
            them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br/><strong>You:</strong> <em> “Ok. Is there anything else I can bring you, right now?” </em> 
            <br/><strong>Guest:</strong>
            <em> “Nope. It looks like we have everything.” </em> 
            <br/><strong>You:</strong> <em> “Great! Enjoy it, and I’ll be back around.” </em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            While you’re at the table you should also offer to bring new glasses of wine
            or cocktails, if you notice it’s appropriate. And you should make a mental note of
            how close your guests are to needing refills on any nonalcoholic beverages, so that you
            can bring those back with you when you come around again.
        </p>


        <h3>13. Check Back</h3>

        <p>
            Checking back shortly after the main course is delivered is important to 
            ensure that guests have everything they need and that their orders are to their liking.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Check back should happen within two minutes or two bites. That leaves enough time for
                the guest to get into what they have and determine if there is anything they
                need, without leaving them waiting too long if things aren’t right.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Your check back should always be specific.
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>“How is your Chicken Parmigiana?”</em>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <em>“Are we enjoying the pizza?”</em>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    This will help to personalize your interactions.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Generic questions only elicit generic responses and we really want to know how the guest
                    is enjoying their experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                This is a good time to also do some table maintenance and double-check beverages for
                refills.
            </li>
        </ul>
