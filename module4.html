        <h1>Professional Service</h1>

        <p>
            Being a great server is about a lot more than just taking people’s orders and
            bringing them food. Service is about providing for the guests’ needs, making them feel comfortable
            and well taken care of, and doing it seamlessly and efficiently.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The server has many roles which can be summed up as follows: 
            <br/>#1 Role: To sell
            <br/>#2 Role: To service
            <br/>#3 Role: To satisfy 
            <br/>#4 Role: To see them again
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Be prepared
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Being prepared starts with showing up on time, in uniform and ready to work. “Ready
            to work” means physically and mentally. You have to be focused on the task at
            hand and bring a positive attitude. It also means double-checking that the restaurant is set
            and ready to go, especially, your own station.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Be friendly and make eye contact
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Professional service takes personality. Always make eye contact with guests to let them know you
            are listening and focused on them.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Consolidate
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            One of the biggest mistakes new servers make is trying to get things done one
            piece at a time. When you’re busy that can get overwhelming. To be efficient and
            get everything done in a timely fashion, you have to consolidate. Instead of taking care
            of everything one table needs and then checking on the next, it works better to
            work your whole section like one big table. Walk through and check on everybody, then
            go do everything you can and bring back whatever you need for everyone all at
            once.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Anticipate
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Always try to stay ahead of your guests’ needs. Try to predict what they’ll need
            and get it for them before they even have to ask. The less they have
            to look for something they don’t have, the better.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Take a moment to stop and assess 
        </h3>

        <p>
            It can be easy to get overwhelmed and
            end up chasing your tail, always one step behind. You can prevent that by simply
            slowing down and taking thirty seconds to think through exactly what’s happening in your station
            and what each guest needs next. Then make a quick plan for the next few
            steps and get going again.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Write it down
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Always, always, always. This will reassure the guest that you’ll get it right, and help
            save you from both mistakes and embarrassment.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Say Thank You
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Use this one at every opportunity: as you take orders, before you walk away from
            the table, when presenting the check, when guests are leaving. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
            you.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Recognize regular guests
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Maria’s is a neighborhood family restaurant and we get a lot of frequent return diners.
            It makes them feel special and like part of the family when we recognize them
            and especially when you greet them by name. Even a guest in another server’s station
            should be greeted with a friendly hello, again using their name if possible. Who knows,
            they could be a guest in your station the next time they dine at Maria’s!
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Teamwork makes the dream work
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Being a better server means being a better team member. Don’t forget, every guest at
            Maria’s is your guest. Even if they aren’t in your section, you’re still a part
            of the team taking care of them. Guests who are well taken care of come
            back, and they may be leaving their tip in your section next time. Help restock,
            pre-bus a neighbor’s table, refill waters and teas throughout the dining room and, of course,
            everyone seats guests at Maria’s, so keep an eye on the front door.
        </p>

        <h2>Ringing Orders and Timing Courses</h2>
        <p>
            Once a table has given you an order, the next step is to get it
            immediately rung in, so that the food gets out to your guests as soon as
            possible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As you ring orders in, you need to make sure you are ringing according to
            seat number, and considering the timing of multiple courses, if you have any.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Timing Courses
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            As a general rule, you want entrées to arrive at the table just about the
            time your guests are finishing with their first course. If your table is sharing an
            appetizer, it’s probably ok if the entrées arrive before the appetizer is completely gone, but
            if you have four guests all having their own salad to start, you don’t want
            the entrée’s to arrive when they’re only halfway through those salads.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It’s important to remember that as soon as you send a ticket to the kitchen,
            it immediately goes into the line to be prepared and sent out to the table,
            as soon as it’s ready. In most instances with multiple courses, you’ll probably be able
            to ring your first course and send it, followed immediately by ringing and sending the
            entrées and the timing is likely to work out.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But occasionally, you may find that you need to use the HOLD function in the
            POS, which allows you to ring your items in without immediately sending the ticket to
            the kitchen, so that you can you can better control the timing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When you’re deciding whether you should use the HOLD function for a second course, there
            are three basic things you need to consider
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                What are the guests’ needs?
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some guests, especially at lunch, may be in more of a hurry than others so
                    you wouldn’t want to hold those entrées for very long, if even at all. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                How long will the items take to prepare?
            </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every item has a different preparation time. You may need to consider how long both
                    the appetizers and the entrées generally take to reach the table.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    A special note on preparation time: all baked dishes, including pizza, take a minimum of
                    20 minutes once the kitchen receives the ticket for them. So, entrée courses that include
                    a baked dish probably don’t ever need to be held.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>
                How busy is the kitchen?
            </li>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A busy kitchen will obviously take a little longer to get a ticket prepared and
                    out once they receive it, so you may want to send your second course a
                    little earlier, so it gets into the line sooner.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Learning to pace your tables and time the courses appropriately will come with experience and
            practice. You’ll get plenty of chances to see your trainers’ timing in action, so make
            sure you pick their brains about the how and why.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To start with, talk through the following scenarios with your trainer and explain to them
            how you would time them:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                First Course: Two side Caesar salads <br/>Second Course: Chicken Piccata and Meat Ravioli
            </li>
            
            <li>
                First Course: Split full Cleopatra Salad <br/>Second Course: Chicken Parmigiana and Shrimp Maria (at lunch)
            </li>
            
            <li>
                First Course: Meatballs and Calamari <br/>Second Course: Boulevard Pizza to share
            </li>
            
            <li>
                First Course: Bruschetta to share <br/>Second Course: Pasta Carbonara and Mushroom Risotto
            </li>
            
            <li>
                First Course: Minestrone Soup and Formaggio Fritti <br/>Second Course: Vegetarian Lasagna and Clams with Linguine
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Ringing According to Seat Number</h3>
        <p>
            Ringing in all your items by seat number allows you, or anyone who may help
            you run your food, to deliver food and drinks to guests without having to “auction
            off” items (ask “who gets what?”). Using the seat numbers is not optional and every
            table needs to be rung by using them correctly.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/seating.png" alt = "Visual rep of seating numbers" />
            <p class="caption">For booths, seat position #1 is the first seat on your left, and then around
                clockwise (See diagram).</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Notice that if just two guests are sitting at a table, they are always positions
            1 and 2 (as seen in the right hand diagram), and not positions 2 and 3.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>At freestanding tables we use the kitchen as a reference point</strong> to identify the starting
            point, so that everyone is ringing correctly. Standing at any freestanding table with your back
            to the kitchen, Position #1 is the first person to the left and then you'll
            continue around the table clockwise.
        </p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/seating2.png" alt = "Visual rep of seating numbers 2" />
            <p class="caption">With your back to the kitchen, Position #1 is the first to your left</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Again, if there are only two people at a table, they will always be positions
            1 and 2, with position 1 being the first person to the left of the
            reference point no matter which seat that ends up being.
        </p>

        <h2>Handling Guest Complaints</h2>
        <p>
            Even with the most efficient service you will occasionally have an unhappy guest. It doesn’t
            matter what happened or whose “fault” it is: our responsibility is to work to make
            things right and correct the situation. There are many dining options out there these days
            and guests who experience problems in our restaurants might not give us another chance, if
            we don’t handle the situation properly. In fact, it is estimated that every unhappy guest
            shares their experience with an average of twelve other people! So, when we fail to
            turn the experience around so that the guest leaves satisfied, we risk losing not just
            their business, but the business of their family and friends, as well. That’s why handling
            guest complaints properly and professionally is so important.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When handled correctly, guest complaints are a great opportunity to build a loyal return guest.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The following four steps can help you diffuse most guest situations and turn that experience
            around. <br/> <strong>L</strong>-Listen <br/> <strong>A</strong>-Apologize <br/> <strong>S</strong>-Solve <br/> <strong>T</strong>-Thank
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Listen to the Guest
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Sometimes, all that’s needed is to allow a guest to voice their concern or complaint,
            and being attentive to that will go a long way. Listen to the entire complaint,
            ask for details and try to understand the guest’s point of view. Don’t get defensive
            or interrupt, and certainly don’t ever argue with a guest.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Apologize
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Always apologize. Whether you think you, or the restaurant, have done anything wrong, the guest
            has not had the experience they expected. Apologies go a long way and it immediately
            lets the guest know that you’re concerned. Don’t offer excuses or place blame. Just apologize.
            <br/> <em>“I am so sorry we didn’t get that right for you. We’ll get it
            fixed, right away.”</em>
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Solve the Problem
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Above all else, we need to get the problem corrected, so you should take immediate
            steps to make that happen as quickly as possible. Whatever the complaint, even if it’s
            simple and easily fixed, you should always inform the manager on duty. Even if you’ve
            already set the correction in motion, the manager stills needs to know so that they
            can help ensure that the problem is fixed quickly and accurately. The manager will also
            visit the table and/or do something extra for the guest.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Thank the Guest
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Once the problem has been solved, thank the guest. Like an apology, “thank you” goes
            a long way. <br/> <em>“Everything the way we need it? Perfect! Enjoy, and thank you!”
            </em><br/> You might wonder why we want to thank someone for complaining. You are thanking
            them for bringing the situation to our attention, and thanking them for allowing us to
            correct it. Most people don’t complain when they’re unhappy, and that’s bad. It’s only by
            guests letting us know when we drop the ball that we can correct the specific
            problem have problems that need to be fixed so we can prevent future mistakes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Getting this right is important and, even though it seems easy, it can take a
            little finesse. You’ll get a chance to practice through some role-play with your trainer.
