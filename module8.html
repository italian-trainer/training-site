        <ol start = "14">
            <h3><li>Clear Main Course</li></h3>
            <p>
                As soon as the guests are done with their main courses, they should be cleared
                from the table. Ideally this means that everything is cleared at once, rather than one
                guest at a time, so that you can avoid having one guest continuing to eat
                while another guest has nothing in front of them.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After the main course is cleared there should be nothing left on the table except
                beverages and potentially anything the guest has requested to keep.
            </p>

            <h3><li> Offer Dessert/Coffee</li></h3>
            <p>
                Once the table is cleared it’s time to talk coffee and dessert.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each guest should be presented with a dessert tray along with some specific suggestions from
                    you:
                </li>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>“Are we ready for some Cheesecake or Tiramisu?”</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <li>
                    It is ok to make suggestions for both dessert and coffee while you’re clearing the
                    table, but if doing so, you should have menus with you ready to present.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Don’t just assume the guest won’t want anything. Instead, assume that they will, and provide
                    them with the options. Use your sales skills.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Once you have a dessert order, ring it in immediately.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    If your guests decline dessert, skip to step 17: Present Check
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><li>Serve Dessert and Coffee (within 2-3 minutes)</li></h3>
            <p>
                Once the dessert order is in, it should be ready to serve quickly. Don’t forget
                to consider any fresh silverware or share plates the guests will need, and if you
                can, get that to the table ahead of time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When delivering dessert or coffee to the table, you should follow all the same steps
                as delivering any course. Announce the items you serving and double check to ensure that
                everyone has everything they need.
            </p>


            <h3><li>Present Check</li></h3>
            <p>
                The check should be presented as soon as desserts are on the table, or, if
                desserts are declined, as soon after you’ve cleared the table as possible. Checks should be
                placed face up in a check presenter and the presenter should be placed as near
                as possible to the host, if one can be identified. If not, simply place the
                check near the middle of the table.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>“I’ll just leave this here, and I’ll take it when you’re ready.”</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once you’ve dropped the check, keep an eye out for the guests to be ready
                to pay so that you can retrieve it and run the payment as quickly as
                possible
            </p>


            <h3><li>Process Payment</li></h3>
            <p>
                We don’t want to rush our guests out the door, but once they’ve finished their
                meals, we don’t want to keep them waiting either. Payments should be processed and returned
                to the table as quickly as possible.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When dealing with cash, it is very important to take extra precautions to ensure accuracy
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Always give guests exact change.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Don’t ever “assume the tip”. Unless the guest has already told you otherwise, return all
                    change to the table, and let the guest provide the appropriate tip.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Double count the amount the guest gives you and any change that you are providing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Credit Cards have their own considerations.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Always make sure you run credit cards on the correct table. Making a mistake here
                    is easier than you think, especially when you’re busy, and once the guest is gone,
                    it might not be something we can fix.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Once the credit card approves and prints, wrap the Guest Copy around the credit card
                    and place both copies in the check presenter, along with a pen, and return it
                    immediately to the table.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Occasionally, you will find that a credit card has been declined. When this happens, it
                    is important that you handle the situation with discretion. Always try the card twice, and
                    if it is declined both times, place it back into the check presenter and return
                    to the table for an alternative form of payment.
                </li>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        “Unfortunately, I’m not able to get this card to go through. Would you like to
                        try another card?”
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Never blame or embarrass the guest. This can be an awkward enough situation without making
                        them defensive.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Almost without fail guests say something like “Huh, that’s weird.” Then they just hand you
                        another card.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Occasionally, a guest will ask you to try again. You don’t need to tell them
                        you already did. Simply agree and do so.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        If for any reason the guest escalates the situation, or becomes upset, you should defer
                        to a manager. Do not argue with any guest.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As a server, collecting and processing payment is an important part of your job. It
                is also one that carries a lot of responsibility. Both the restaurant and the guest
                will be trusting you with their money. Cash and credit card handling procedures are in
                place to protect you, the guest and the restaurant, and you are accountable for following
                them just like all the other rules of the restaurant.
            </p>

            <h3><li>Thank and Invite to Return</li></h3>
            <p>
                The last step, and one of the most important, is to thank the guest and
                invite them to return.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>
                    “Thanks for coming in. Have a wonderful evening and I hope we see you again,
                    soon!”
                </em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You should certainly do this when returning to the table with the guests’ payment, but
                that’s the not the only time it can happen. You can say it again when
                your guests are on the way out the door, and they don’t even have to
                be your guests.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You should acknowledge any guest that you see leaving. That’s part of our warm and
                friendly neighborhood restaurant atmosphere and part of the “of service” attitude.
